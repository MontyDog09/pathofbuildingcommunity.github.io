<section class="what-is-this">
	<div class="text-container">
		This is a fork of the original Path of Building by Openarl, maintained by community members. Features not originally present have been added, and new mechanics are getting supported regularly. By building upon the abilities of a community of developers and players, as well as an open invitation for anyone to come in and help, we can advance much faster.<br/><br/>

		In practice, this means that we support things such as impale, many minion related calculations, accurate shock calculations, catalysts, anointments, crafting and much more.<br/><br/>

		This project also needs your help! Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/issues">Issue Tracker</a> if you're a developer that knows some Lua, or help us find out bugs and what is lacking.

			Path of Building Community Edition has been actively maintained for over a year. The list is quite literally too long to fit on this page. In addition to all the features that are added, Openarl's work is integrated in this project too, making sure we also have his latest work included.

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<div class="faq-container">
			<h3>I've already got the regular PoB, how do I change over to this one?</h3>
			Download the updated installer from our <a href="https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/releases">Releases</a> page and reinstall it. The previous method of modifying the manifest is deprecated and is not advised.

			<h3>A mod/keystone/skill/spectre/item is missing, how do I get it?</h3>
			Feel free to search through the <a href="https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/issues">issues</a> to see if it has already been reported, and open one if needed. As always with those things, remember the humans behind this project. We're all working on it for free, on our free time. It might take a while for the problem to be fixed.
