		This is a fork of the original Path of Building by Openarl, maintained by community members. Features not originally present have been added, and new mechanics are getting supported regularly. By building upon the abilities of a community of developers and players, as well as an open invitation for anyone to come in and help, we can advance much faster.<br/><br/>

		In practice, this means that we support things such as impale, many minion related calculations, accurate shock calculations, catalysts, anointments, crafting and much more.<br/><br/>

		This project also needs your help! Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/issues">Issue Tracker</a> if you're a developer that knows some Lua, or help us find out bugs and what is lacking.
